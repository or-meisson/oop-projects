1) My code is divided to 4 main packages. The image package is responsible for handling all the manipulations
on the image. It is divided to 4 classes that have a certain role regarding to the image. The Image class
which is responsible for a single image creation, it's dimensions and it's saving, the ImgBrightnessCalculator
 which is responsible for calculating the brightness of a single image, the ImagePadder, which is responsible
to pad a single image to the nearest power of 2, and the ImgSplitter class which is responsible for taking a
single image and splitting it to smaller images.
The image_char_matching package is responsible for handling all the cases that connect "char images" to
"color images".
it is made of 3 classes:
The CharBrightnessCalculator is responsible for calculating the brightness of a single char,
 the CharConverter is responsible for converting characters to binary "color images", and the
 SubImgCharConverter is responsible for matching each sub image to it's most appropriate char based on
 its normalized brightness. It is also responsible for saving all the calculated brightnesses in a hash map,
,for adding and removing chars from the hash map and for clearing the hash map. It is also responsible for
saving the min and max brightnesses of the chars and updating them when needed without needing to go over
the whole hash map.
The ascii_art package is responsible for handling the ascii art creation itself. It is made of 3 classes
(including the KeyboardInput who is not attached to this exercise). The asciiArt algorithm class is
responsible for running a whole process of creating an ascii image, from padding the image, splitting it,
calculating the brightnesses based on other classes and then returning the ascii image.
 The shell class is responsible for all the user interface - it is responsible for getting the wanted image
 from the user, getting the wanted chars and the wanted resolution and so on. it then uses the
ascii art algorithm to output the processed image. It also handles the user's mistakes with exceptions.
The exceptions package is a package that contains all the exceptions the shell deals with in the different
scenarios. (more on this in 3)
2) In the SubImgCharMatcher I used a hash map because it has the best complexity time for insertion,
deletion and retrieval in O(1),  with space complexity of O(n), it also very convenient to retrieve char
 brightness easily.
 In the Shell class I chose to use a tree set for storing the characters, because it was the most convenient
 to store that way chars in alphabetical order without duplicates and with good complexity time of O(log n)
 for insertion, deletion and retrieval and O(n) space complexity.
3) The AddIncorrectFormatException and RemoveIncorrectFormatException deals with wrong input chars to add 
or to remove to the algorithm, the OutputIncorrectFormatException and the ResolutionIncorrectFormatException
are dealing with invalid format of choosing output stream or resolution, the
ResolutionExceedingBoundariesException deals with the case that the user picks too large or too small
boundaries, the EmptyCharSetException deals with the case that the user tries to run the algorithm
without any chars, and th IncorrectCommandException deals with incorrect command that is none of the above. I
 caught those exceptions in the Shell's run method, printed an informative message and waited for the user to
    input a correct command.
4) I added a public method void clear() that is responsible for clearing the hash map and resetting
the min and max brightnesses when we need to remove all chars.
